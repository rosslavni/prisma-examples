# Contributing to Prisma Examples

## Goals of the Prisma Examples

This repository contains a number of examples that show the _minimalistic_ setup for using Prisma for specific use cases. We're trying to remove all unnecessary complexity from the examples to keep them as simple as possible.

The examples are not demonstrating a production-ready and feature-complete setup, instead they're showing you the bare minimum of what's required.
