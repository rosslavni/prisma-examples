# PostgreSQL with Docker Example

This example shows how to **set up Prisma using Docker and PostgreSQL** locally on your machine. It then uses the Prisma client in a simple TypeScript script to read and write data in the database.

> This example uses a new and empty database. **Learn how to connect Prisma to your existing database [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/-a003/)**.

cd prisma-examples/typescript/docker-postgres
npm install
```

### 2. Launch Prisma with Docker

This example is based on Docker. If you don't have Docker installed, you can get it from [here](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community). Use the Docker Compose CLI to launch the Docker containers specified in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml):

```
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Install the Prisma CLI

To run the example, you need the Prisma CLI. Please install it via NPM or [using another method](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-cli-and-configuration/using-the-prisma-cli-alx4/#installation):

```
npm install -g prisma
```

### 4. Set up database & deploy Prisma datamodel

To deploy the datamodel for this example, run the following command:

```
prisma deploy
```

### 5. Run the script

Execute the script with this command: 

```
npm run start
```
